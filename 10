Welcome to my portfolio of lab work, scripts, and more. 
I've just finished my first term as a Computer Systems Technician - Networking student at Algonquin College in Ottawa.

Level One of my program consisted of the following:
    - GNU/Linux Desktop Support (using RHEL 9.6 in VMWare Workstation Pro 17.5)
    - Windows Desktop Support (automating tasks very chance I ge)
    - Networking Fundamentals (CCNA: Intro to Networks)
    - Numeracy and Logic (special focus on CNS, logic gates, and statistics)
    - Achieving Success in Changing Environments (collaborating with peers & navigating this ever-changing world)
